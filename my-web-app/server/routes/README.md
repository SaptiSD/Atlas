# Server Routes Documentation

This directory contains the route definitions for the server-side application. Routes are essential for handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate controllers.

## Structure

- Each route file should correspond to a specific resource or functionality within the application.
- Routes are typically organized by feature or resource type to maintain clarity and ease of management.

## Usage

1. **Creating a New Route**:
   - Create a new file within this directory for the route.
   - Define the route using Express.js syntax, specifying the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and the corresponding controller function.

2. **Example**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   const myController = require('../controllers/myController');

   router.get('/my-resource', myController.getMyResource);
   router.post('/my-resource', myController.createMyResource);

   module.exports = router;
   ```

3. **Integrating Routes**:
   - Import the route file in `app.ts` and use it with the Express application instance.
   ```javascript
   const myRoutes = require('./routes/myRoutes');
   app.use('/api', myRoutes);
   ```

## Best Practices

- Keep route files small and focused on a single resource.
- Use meaningful names for route files and functions to enhance readability.
- Document each route with comments explaining its purpose and usage.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage the routes in your server-side application.
