# File: /my-web-app/my-web-app/client/public/README.md

This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the Next.js application. 

## Purpose of the Public Directory

- The `public` directory is used to store static files such as images, fonts, and other assets that do not require processing by Webpack.
- Files in this directory can be accessed directly via the base URL of the application.

## Usage

- Place your static assets in this directory to make them available for use in your application.
- For example, an image located at `public/images/logo.png` can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png` when running the application locally.

## Best Practices

- Organize your assets into subdirectories (e.g., `assets`, `images`, `fonts`) for better maintainability.
- Use descriptive names for your files to make it easier to identify their purpose.
