# FILE: /my-web-app/my-web-app/client/public/assets/README.md

This folder is designated for organizing and storing images and other static assets used in the application. 

## Organization
- Place images in this directory, categorized by type if necessary (e.g., `images`, `icons`).
- Ensure that file names are descriptive and use lowercase letters with hyphens for spaces (e.g., `user-profile.png`).

## Usage
- To reference an asset in your components or pages, use the relative path from the `public` directory. For example, to use an image named `logo.png`, you would reference it as `/assets/logo.png`.

## Best Practices
- Optimize images for web use to improve loading times.
- Regularly review and clean up unused assets to maintain organization.
