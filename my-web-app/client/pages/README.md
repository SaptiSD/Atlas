# Pages Directory

The `pages` directory is a fundamental part of a Next.js application. Each file within this directory automatically becomes a route in your application. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its structure and usage:

## Structure

- **api/**: Contains serverless functions that can be accessed via API routes. Each file in this folder corresponds to an API endpoint.
- **_app.tsx**: This is the custom App component that initializes pages. It allows you to persist layout between page changes and inject additional data into pages.
- **index.tsx**: This is the main entry point of the application, rendering the homepage.

## Usage

- To create a new page, simply add a new `.tsx` file in this directory. The filename will determine the route.
- For dynamic routes, you can use square brackets in the filename (e.g., `[id].tsx`).
- Use the `_app.tsx` file to wrap your pages with layout components or to include global styles.

This structure allows for a clean and organized way to manage the different views of your application while leveraging the powerful routing capabilities of Next.js.
