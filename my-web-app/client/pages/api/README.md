# API Routes Documentation

This directory contains the API routes for the Next.js application. API routes provide a solution to build your API with JavaScript and TypeScript, allowing you to create serverless functions that can be deployed alongside your application.

## Creating API Routes

- Each file in this directory corresponds to an API endpoint. For example, `hello.js` would be accessible at `/api/hello`.
- You can export a default function from each file to handle requests. This function receives the request and response objects as parameters.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of an API route:

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
}
```

## Managing API Routes

- You can create subdirectories within this folder to organize your API routes logically.
- Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to handle different types of requests within the same file by checking `req.method`.

## Best Practices

- Keep your API routes stateless and avoid heavy computations.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information.
- Implement error handling to manage different scenarios gracefully.

This structure allows for easy scalability and maintainability of your API as your application grows.
