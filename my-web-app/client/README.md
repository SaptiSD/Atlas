# README for Client-Side Application

This README file provides an overview of the client-side structure of the web application built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. 

## Directory Structure

- **pages/**: Contains all the pages of the application. Each file corresponds to a route based on its filename.
  - **api/**: Contains serverless functions that can be accessed via API routes.
  - **_app.tsx**: Custom App component that initializes pages and can be used for global state management and styles.
  - **index.tsx**: The main entry point of the application, rendering the homepage.

- **components/**: This directory is for reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.

- **public/**: Contains static assets that can be served directly. This includes images, fonts, and other files.
  - **assets/**: A subdirectory for organizing images and other assets used in the application.

- **styles/**: Contains all the styling files for the application.
  - **tailwind.css**: Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities.
  - **globals.css**: Contains global styles that apply to the entire application.

## Usage

To get started with the client-side application:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory.
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

This structure allows for easy management and scalability of the client-side code, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and promoting reusability.
