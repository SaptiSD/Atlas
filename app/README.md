# My Web App

This project is a web application built using React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. It is structured into two main parts: the client-side and the server-side.

## Project Structure

- **client/**: Contains all the client-side code, including pages, components, and styles.
- **server/**: Contains the server-side code, including controllers and routes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-web-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both client and server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

5. In a separate terminal, run the server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

## Client-Side

The client-side of the application is built with Next.js, which allows for server-side rendering and static site generation. The main entry point is located in `client/pages/index.tsx`.

### Key Directories

- **pages/**: Contains the application's pages. Each file corresponds to a route based on its filename.
- **components/**: Contains reusable React components.
- **public/**: Contains static assets that can be served directly.
- **styles/**: Contains CSS files, including Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Server-Side

The server-side of the application is built with Node.js and Express. It handles API requests and serves data to the client.

### Key Directories

- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests.
- **routes/**: Defines the API routes for the application.

## Additional Information

For more detailed documentation, refer to the README files located in each subdirectory. Each of these files provides specific information about the structure and usage of that part of the application.
