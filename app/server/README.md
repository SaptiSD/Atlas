# Server Documentation

This folder contains the server-side implementation of the web application. It is built using Node.js and Express, providing the backend functionality for the application.

## Directory Structure

- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses. Each controller is responsible for a specific part of the application.
- **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints and associates them with the appropriate controllers.
- **app.ts**: The main entry point for the server application. This file sets up the Express server, middleware, and routes.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the server directory to install the required packages.
2. **Start the Server**: Use `npm start` to launch the server. Ensure that the server is running before accessing the client application.
3. **API Endpoints**: Refer to the `routes/README.md` for details on available API endpoints and their usage.

## Development

- Follow best practices for structuring controllers and routes to maintain clean and manageable code.
- Ensure that all API responses are properly formatted and include error handling.

This documentation will help you understand the server-side structure and how to work with it effectively.
