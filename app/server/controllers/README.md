# FILE: /my-web-app/my-web-app/server/controllers/README.md

This directory contains the controllers for handling requests in the server-side application. 

## Structure and Usage

- **Purpose**: Controllers are responsible for processing incoming requests, interacting with the model, and returning responses to the client.
- **Creating a Controller**: To create a new controller, create a new JavaScript or TypeScript file in this directory. Define functions that correspond to the various endpoints you want to handle.
- **Exporting Functions**: Ensure that each function is exported so that it can be used in the routes.
- **Example**: A typical controller might look like this:

```javascript
// exampleController.js
exports.getExample = (req, res) => {
    res.send('This is an example response');
};
```

- **Integration with Routes**: Import the controller functions in your route files to link them with specific endpoints.

By organizing your controllers in this manner, you can maintain a clean and manageable codebase, making it easier to scale and maintain your application.
