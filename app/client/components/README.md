# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable components for the application. Components are the building blocks of the user interface and can be used across different pages to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.

## Guidelines for Creating Components

1. **Component Structure**: Each component should be placed in its own folder within this directory. The folder name should match the component name (e.g., `Button`, `Header`).

2. **File Naming**: Use PascalCase for component file names (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Header.tsx`).

3. **Exporting Components**: Each component should be exported as a default export from its file to facilitate easy imports.

4. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling components. Avoid using inline styles to maintain consistency across the application.

5. **Props**: Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety and improve code readability.

6. **Documentation**: Document each component with comments explaining its purpose, props, and usage examples.

## Example Component Structure

```
components/
├── Button/
│   ├── Button.tsx
│   └── README.md
└── Header/
    ├── Header.tsx
    └── README.md
```

By following these guidelines, you can create maintainable and reusable components that enhance the overall quality of the application.
